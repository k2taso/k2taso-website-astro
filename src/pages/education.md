Education is one of the bet methods to raise people out of poverty.  K2 TASO provides financial academic support towards school fees and other relevant academic accessories to needy students during their secondary (elementary) school.

We also facilitate access to computer studies with support from Bridges to Malawi, our American partner organization.  We install solar power followed by donation of computers and various accessories such as projectors. We also maintain the computers, train teachers how to teach computer skills, and teach programming skills.  The computers are loaded with Kahn Academy, a complete western-style education, which can supplement or drive the studentsâ€™ studies.
