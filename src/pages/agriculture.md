## Pass-on Livestock

The community’s nutrition and wealth can drastically improve though the small push of an animal support to beneficiaries under our pass-on program.  An initial recipient receives an animal, which is allowed to give birth and the offspring is passed on to second recipient and the subsequent young delivered from the initially donated animal remains with the initial recipient.
Our goat pass on program is now self-sustaining.

The program can transform a family’s life, as the milk or eggs and meat add much needed protein to the diet and brings in additional money to the family.

## Dairy Cow Farming

K2 has joined the Malawian government’s efforts in promoting dairy cow farming. Dairy cows are part of our pass-on program. We educate the farmers in the care and housing needs, and we provide animal husbandry services to breed more cows to pass on to other beneficiaries.
